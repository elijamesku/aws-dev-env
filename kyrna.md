# S3 Bucket Infrastructure

This infrastructure creates a simple AWS S3 bucket with a randomly generated suffix to ensure global uniqueness. The bucket is configured with default settings and can be used for general object storage purposes.

## Resources Created

| Resource | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `aws_s3_bucket.main` | [aws_s3_bucket](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket) | Primary S3 bucket for object storage |
| `random_id.bucket_suffix` | [random_id](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/id) | Generates unique suffix for bucket naming |

## Deployment

Deploy this infrastructure using standard Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Cost Estimate

**Monthly Cost**: ~$0.023 per GB stored + request charges
- Standard storage: $0.023 per GB/month for first 50 TB
- PUT/POST requests: $0.0005 per 1,000 requests
- GET requests: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests

Actual costs depend on storage usage and request patterns.
